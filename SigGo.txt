GOID: GO:0050793
Term: regulation of developmental process
Ontology: BP
Definition: Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or
    extent of development, the biological process whose specific
    outcome is the progression of a multicellular organism over
    time from an initial condition (e.g. a zygote, or a young
    adult) to a later condition (e.g. a multicellular animal or
    an aged adult).
-----------------------------------------
GOID: GO:0010941
Term: regulation of cell death
Ontology: BP
Definition: Any process that modulates the rate or frequency of
    cell death. Cell death is the specific activation or halting
    of processes within a cell so that its vital functions
    markedly cease, rather than simply deteriorating gradually
    over time, which culminates in cell death.

Term: enzyme-linked receptor protein signaling pathway
Ontology: BP
Definition: The series of molecular signals initiated by an
    extracellular ligand binding to a receptor on the surface of
    the target cell, where the receptor possesses catalytic
    activity or is closely associated with an enzyme such as a
    protein kinase, and ending with the regulation of a
    downstream cellular process, e.g. transcription.
